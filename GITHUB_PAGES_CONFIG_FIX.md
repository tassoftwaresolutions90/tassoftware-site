# 🔧 GitHub Pages Configuration Fix

## ✅ **Good News:**
Your GitHub Pages is properly configured and the site is live at `http://tassoftware.online/`

## ❌ **Issues to Fix:**

### **Issue 1: DNS Configuration Failed**
```
DNS check unsuccessful
Both tassoftware.online and its alternate name are improperly configured
Domain does not resolve to the GitHub Pages server
```

### **Issue 2: No gh-pages Branch**
The gh-pages branch doesn't exist, which means the deployment hasn't happened yet.

## ✅ **Step-by-Step Fix:**

### **Step 1: Fix DNS Configuration**

**Add these DNS records to your domain provider:**

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.111.153

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: tassoftwaresolutions90.github.io
```

**Important:** Wait 5-10 minutes after adding DNS records for propagation.

### **Step 2: Create gh-pages Branch (Deploy)**

Since the gh-pages branch doesn't exist, we need to deploy first:

**Option A: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)**
1. Go to: `https://github.com/tassoftwaresolutions90/tassoftware-site/actions`
2. Find the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" or "Re-run all jobs"
4. Wait for it to complete

**Option B: Manual Deployment**
```bash
# When Node.js is available:
npm install
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### **Step 3: Update Pages Source**

**After gh-pages branch is created:**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/tassoftwaresolutions90/tassoftware-site/settings/pages`
2. Under **"Source"**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Select **"gh-pages"** branch
4. Select **"/ (root)"** folder
5. Click **"Save"**

### **Step 4: Verify HTTPS**

**After DNS is fixed:**
1. Go back to Pages settings
2. Check **"Enforce HTTPS"**
3. Save

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

After fixing DNS and deploying:
- ✅ **Site URL**: `https://tassoftware.online/`
- ✅ **HTTPS enabled**: Secure connection
- ✅ **DNS check successful**: No more DNS errors
- ✅ **gh-pages branch exists**: Deployment successful

## 📋 **Current Status:**

- ✅ **GitHub Pages**: Enabled and configured
- ✅ **Custom domain**: Set to tassoftware.online
- ❌ **DNS records**: Need to be added
- ❌ **gh-pages branch**: Need to be created
- ❌ **HTTPS**: Not available until DNS is fixed

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Add DNS records** to your domain provider
2. **Deploy the website** (create gh-pages branch)
3. **Wait for DNS propagation** (5-10 minutes)
4. **Enable HTTPS** in Pages settings
5. **Test your website** at https://tassoftware.online/

**The main issues are DNS configuration and missing deployment. Fix these and your website will be live!** 🚀
