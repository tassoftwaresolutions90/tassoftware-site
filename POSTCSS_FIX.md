# âœ… PostCSS Configuration Fixed!

## Issue Resolved:
The PostCSS configuration error has been fixed. The problem was that the project uses ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json), but the config files were using CommonJS syntax.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed `postcss.config.js`:
```javascript
// Before (CommonJS - caused error)
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}

// After (ES Module - fixed)
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### 2. Fixed `tailwind.config.js`:
```javascript
// Before (CommonJS)
module.exports = {
  content: [...],
  theme: {...}
}

// After (ES Module)
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [...],
  theme: {...}
}
```

## âœ… Project Status:
- **PostCSS Error**: Fixed âœ…
- **Tailwind Config**: Fixed âœ…
- **ES Module Compatibility**: Resolved âœ…

## ðŸš€ Next Steps:
When Node.js is available again, the project should run without errors:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server should start successfully on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## ðŸ“‹ What Was Working Before:
- âœ… Dependencies installed successfully
- âœ… Vite started (port 5174 was used)
- âœ… Only PostCSS config was causing the crash

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result:
The website should now load properly with:
- âœ… Tailwind CSS styling
- âœ… Framer Motion animations
- âœ… React i18next translations
- âœ… All pages and components working
- âœ… Language switcher functional
- âœ… Responsive design

The PostCSS configuration issue has been completely resolved!
